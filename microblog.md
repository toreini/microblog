### Citizenship
*2025-11-06*

The distinction between humanship and citizenship is occupying my mind recently. It is interesting how modern societies evolve around a concept of nation (and political border). As government, the institution is mandated to protect its citizens, not all the humans living in their countries. The digital world is border-less, yet such concepts are somehow replicated there. GDPR is a good example. Verifiable Credentials are the next to shape the notion of citizenship documents in digital world. I strongly believe having it is better than not, but I think there are many complex trust-building ingredients to resolve. I will talk about them gradually, as my brain dumps get more structured.

### Complexity of State Building
*2025-11-06*

I am recently reading Francis Fukuyama's book on "[State-Building: Governance and World Order in the 21st Century](https://www.amazon.co.uk/State-Building-Governance-World-Century-ebook/dp/B071NQBFQ8?ref_=ast_author_dp_rw&th=1&psc=1&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.bnOUApW4AgtcrDzVbo5gcfx-CirywpBhIxr4wAvWLCcQdGQxdzftJAABXSjEeg7IVk4SjX4TKas2B8d1QnxcZ5-4AY7jmP6l2rJyPTnExXtpNXOrYE3ksxLMyQgIV9TLBypxBr40N542JrRiTaYHhPS8oCWchNz_YYd7G676D4VY89e6IDElmYIBZ_X-RabCjUJTumUzeIPejPHyVJBKAJJrLMccAJ2j_3UAFwlxyok.dfjVC6JgB2oG7F2U3KA4zBGsypFKsqb9DMTep_MhXTo&dib_tag=AUTHOR)". The institution-building is a sophisticated eco-system of social construct, and this book talk about that. I can relate to that, as it discusses how institutions are made, matured and finally get irrelevant. Something that you can see is happening in front of our eyes in the world.
